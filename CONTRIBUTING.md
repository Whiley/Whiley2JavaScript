## The Whiley Compiler Collection

The Whiley2JavaScript compiler is part of the

This is the overarching framework which brings together components for
compiling, verifying, testing and documenting Whiley programs (and
much more).  The Whiley2JavaScript compiler can be thought of as a
"plugin" within this framework.
