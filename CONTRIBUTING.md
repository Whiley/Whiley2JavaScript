## The Whiley Compiler Collection

The Whiley2JavaScript compiler is part of the
[Whiley Compiler Collection](https://github.com/Whiley/WhileyCompilerCollection).
This is the overarching framework which brings together components for
compiling, verifying, testing and documenting Whiley programs (and
much more).  The Whiley2JavaScript compiler can be thought of as a
"plugin" within this framework.
