/**
 * <p>
 * A type mangler is responsible for turning the list of parameter types for a
 * function, method or property into an appropriate "mangle". That is, a string
 * which uniquely encodes the type. This is necessary because Whiley support
 * overloading of functions, methods and properties. For example, consider this
 * Whiley code:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * function append(int[] xs, int x):
 *    ...
 *
 * function append(int[] xs, int[] ys):
 *    ...
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * Each of these is translated into a WyLL method of the form
 * <code>append_X</code> where <code>X</code> is the appropriate mangle. For the
 * first function above, an appropriate mangle might be "aii", indicating an
 * array of integers and an integer parameter. Then, the second would be "aiai"
 * indicating two arrays of integers.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The actual rules for generating the mangle are platform-dependent. This is
 * because they are constrained by the permitted set of characters in an
 * identifier. As such, the concept of a type mangle is a parameter to the
 * translation process to allow platform-specific customisation.
 * </p>
